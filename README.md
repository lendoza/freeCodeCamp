Free Code Camp
======
**freecodecamp.com** is an online web development bootcamp designed to teach both Front End and Back End Javascript. The course ranges from basic algorithm scripting to full scale web applications. In this repo, I store the algorithm scripts and web apps I have developed. The web apps I completed can be found on my portfolio website: http://leonardlabita.com
